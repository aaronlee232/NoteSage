# Chat Implementation

## Process

1. Message sent by user are sanitized and passed through OpenAPI moderation tool

2. Context is gathered from page_section rows in DB based on dotproduct of page_section content embedding and user message embedding (highest gets chosen). Only page_section rows that match the tags the user specified will be selected

3. conversation history will be gathered based on 2 criteria: recent and relevance. Chat messages are stored in the DB with their embedding. Old and irrelevant messages are automatically pruned with this method.
	- CURRENT PROBLEM: When selecting by relevance, its possible that 2 user messages will be selected instead of 1 user and 1 ai
	- SOLUTION: concatinate the two messages using a special delimiter and store in db with combined embedding. When retreiving messages, split message based on delimiter.

4. User message will be combined with an engineered prompt, context, and conversation history to send to openai api for ai response

5. once ai response is recieved, add latest messages to DB and send message content to chat interface
